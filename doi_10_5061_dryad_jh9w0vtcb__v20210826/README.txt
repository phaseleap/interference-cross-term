Raw Data for:
Haowen Zhou, William E. Perreault, Nandini Mukherjee, Richard N. Zare, (2021), Quantum mechanical double slit for molecular scattering

The excel file consists of three datasheets, which are the scattering angular distrubtions for the three prepared D2 states (45° and 135° uniaxial and XSARP biaxial state), respectively. In each of the datasheet there are two columns, representing the scattering angle theta and the corresponding counts in that angle. These are the data in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2.
